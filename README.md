### Problem statement

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish - you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. Specifically, in this project you should:

* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook

### How to Run:

To run the code locally this repository can be cloned and run using a python IDE or through Jupyter Notebook. The applications used for creation of the project are The Jupyter Notebook and Cmder.

* Download or clone current repository "machine-learning-and-statistics"
* Install Python - This was developed using Anaconda but the modules required to run are detailed in the ```requirements.txt```
* Refer to the ```requirements.txt``` and import as required
* Install Jupyter
* Run in Jupyter notebook
* Open and Run ```PfDA_project_2021.ipynb```
* Once in the notebook, on the menu bar select Kernel and then click on the "Restart and run all" option.
* When you have finished, close or exit the tab in your browser.
* Enter "Ctrl + C" in the command prompt to end the jupyter lab session.
